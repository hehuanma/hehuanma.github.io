## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science Department at University of Texas at Arlington, USA. My major research interests are drug discovery and graph classification, and my current studies focus on utilizing graph neural network to address molecular property prediction problem. My supervisor is Dr. Junzhou Huang.

I received my master degree of Computer Science at Louisiana Tech University in USA, and bachlor degree of Communication Engineering at Huaqiao University in China.
